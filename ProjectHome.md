RWM is a QT Desktop Environment / Window Wanager.
  * The main goal is to develop an interface really simple, fast and beautiful.
  * Follow the K.I.S.S philosophy;
  * Configurations are stored in $home/user/.rwm/ in xml files (simple and human readable);
  * It should depend only on Qt libs;
  * Default style is Oxygen, but others can be selected from qtconfig.

It is based on Antico (you can find the original here: http://www.giuseppecigala.it/Antico.html).
